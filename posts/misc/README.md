## __Useful Tools__

### Extensible Text Editors

Although editors like `nano` get the job done, it can be very useful to learn and get comfortable with an extensible text editor such as [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
Both of these editors have powerful features such as keyboard shortcuts to speed up editing, find and replace, macros to automate repetitive edits and a vast repository of plug-ins

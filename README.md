In the inevitable event that you run into issues it is vital to know how to look for solutions.
Remember that no one knows everything. Knowing how to find answers is a skill in and of itself.
Before asking someone for help, consider trying the following:

* Look at the manual pages for the commands you are trying to use (`man <command-name>`)
* Look at the official documentation for your operating system, or specific service you're troubleshooting
* Search in online forums
